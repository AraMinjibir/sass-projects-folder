## Project Description

This project showcases my fundamental skills in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and SASS. The project was organized into three folders.

### Folders:

1. **assets:**
   - *css:* Contains the compiled CSS file, `style.css`, which is generated by the SASS compiler. It also includes `style.css.map` for debugging purposes, and img housing all the images used throughout this project.
   
2.   - **node-modules:* Contains all Node packages, including the SASS loader.

3. **sass:**
   - *style.scss:* The main file coordinating all project modules.
   
   - *config.scss:* Declares new variables used throughout the project.
   
   - *desktop.scss:* Contains variables specific to desktop styles.
   
   - *mobile.scss:* Declares variables needed for mobile styles.

4. **Other Files:**
    - *index.html:* Contains all markup for the project. The main structure includes:

    - One container with the class 'container'.
    - Within the container, there was a two 'grid-containers' (row) and two div- containers. The first and the last containers contains the top and bottom background-images. While the second and the third are the grid-containers containing columns with company's advert and customers' feedback about the company's products.
    
 - *package.lock.json and package.json:* These files include dependencies, author information, and the project's license.
