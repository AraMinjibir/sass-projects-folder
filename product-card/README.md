## Project Description

This project showcases my fundamental skills in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and SASS. The project was organized into three folders.

### Folders:

1. **assets:**
   - *css:* Contains the compiled CSS file, `style.css`, which is generated by the SASS compiler. It also includes `style.css.map` for debugging purposes, and img housing all the images used throughout this project.
   
2.   - **node-modules:* Contains all Node packages, including the SASS loader.

3. **sass:**
   - *style.scss:* The main file coordinating all project modules.
   
   - *config.scss:* Declares new variables used throughout the project.
   
   - *desktop.scss:* Contains variables specific to desktop styles.
   
   - *mobile.scss:* Declares variables needed for mobile styles.

4. **Other Files:**
    - *index.html:* Contains all markup for the project. The main structure includes:

    - One container with the class 'container-fluid'.
    - Within the container, there was a 'grid-container' (row). There were two colums nested within it, each column spans to 6 columns from mediun devices up to extra-extra-large. The the first column contains the image of Company's products, while the the second column contains products price and more.
    
 - *package.lock.json and package.json:* These files include dependencies, author information, and the project's license.
